                <p>Ripper Roo (Japanese: リパールー/Ripārū) (also known as Doctor Roo) is an insane blue mutated kangaroo
                    widely considered to be Dr. Cortex's first and failed experiment with the Evolvo Ray, which is
                    debatable seeing as how he managed to complete university-level education as of Crash Bandicoot 2:
                    Cortex Strikes Back. He frequently uses explosive crates when battling Crash. This can be seen in
                    Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back, where he lays down TNT squares and nitro squares with his
                    tail, in Crash Team Racing where he drops TNTs, and in his appearance in Crash Bash where he will
                    randomly lay down TNT squares on random tiles. He also has razor sharp toe nails that are his main
                    method of attack. In Crash Team Racing he has a course named after him, called Roo's Tubes.</p>

                <p>The boss fight against Koala Kong (コアラコングは ちからもち lit. Koala Kong is a Strong Man in Japanese) is the
                    second boss level situated on Wumpa Island in a volcanic mine (similar to what the first half of
                    Compactor Reactor would look like), which is the only type of level in the game and Koala Kong is
                    the third boss of Crash Bandicoot and the Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy remaster of the first
                    game. It is the seventeenth level of the game (including boss fights) and the final level of the
                    second island. It starts with him showing Crash his muscles and then he jumps to the left and
                    starts throwing three rocks at Crash. He's across a lava river and behind a mine cart track but it
                    is still operational as mine carts pass, blocking Koala. Koala has four hit points rather than the
                    past bosses, Papu Papu and Ripper Roo, who had three. When Koala picks up a fourth rock he'll walk
                    very slowly and throw it at Crash. It stops in front of him and if he spins it back, it'll hit
                    Koala and take one of his hit points away. TNT crates start dropping from above Crash as Koala's
                    health goes down. There will be more mine carts passing. When Crash spins the final rock at Koala,
                    he'll fall on his back and Crash can move on to Cortex Island. After Koala is defeated, no more
                    mine carts will go past. A good thing to keep in mind is in this boss fight, TNT crates only fall
                    in the middle of the area Crash can stand on. </p>

                <p>Dr. Nitrus Brio (かがくの ニトラス ブリオ lit. Scientific Nitrus Brio in Japanese) is a boss in Crash Bandicoot
                    and Crash Twinsanity (where he is fought alongside Dr. Nefarious Tropy). He appears in Crash: Mind
                    over Mutant, but within Crunch's boss fight. He also reprises his role as the fifth and penultimate
                    boss in the original game in the N. Sane Trilogy. </p>

                    Twinsanity (where Cortex is the first boss and later used by the player), Crash of the Titans
                    (where Cortex is the first boss) and Crash Bandicoot 2: N-Tranced, where he is not a boss due to
                    only appearing in the multiplayer games. </p>
